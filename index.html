            <p>
                <em>AI</em> stands for <strong>"Artificial Intelligence."</strong> It is a field of computer science that aims to create machines<br> 
                that can perform tasks that typically require human-like intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving,<br>
                perception, and decision-making.<br>

                <em>AI</em> involves developing algorithms and models that can learn from and make predictions or decisions based on large amounts<br>
                of data. There are various subfields of <em>AI</em>, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision,<br> 
                robotics, and expert systems.
                <em>AI</em> is increasingly used in a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, autonomous vehicles,<br> 
                fraud detection, personalized medicine, and recommendation systems.<br>
