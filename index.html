                <em>AI</em> involves developing algorithms and models that can learn from and make predictions or decisions based on large amounts<br>
                of data. There are various subfields of <em>AI</em>, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision,<br> 
                robotics, and expert systems.
                <em>AI</em> is increasingly used in a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, autonomous vehicles,<br> 
                fraud detection, personalized medicine, and recommendation systems.<br>
