            <em>Midjourney</em> is an Artificial intelligence program that creates images from textual descriptions or keywords.<br>
            <br>
            Midjourney is an independent AI art generator that turns text-based prompts into images. All you need to do is enter a few words,<br>
            and the tool will provide you with an original image using AI and machine learning. Midjourney differs from other AI art generators because it's open for public use.
